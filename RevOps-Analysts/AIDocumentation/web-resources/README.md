# Web Resources Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation for all web resources (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images) used in the RevOps environment. Web resources extend model-driven app functionality with custom client-side logic.

**Audience:**
- RevOps developers and solution architects
- Copilot agents performing analysis and impact assessment
- Business analysts understanding system capabilities

## What's Documented Here

Each web resource has its own subfolder containing:

- **README.md**: Web resource purpose, usage context, and form associations
- **_facts/resource-info.yaml**: Resource type, content type, and solution membership

## How to Navigate

**To find a specific web resource:**
- Browse subfolders by resource name (normalized with hyphens, lowercase)

**To understand web resource usage:**
- Check README.md for form/view associations
- Review `_facts/resource-info.yaml` for metadata

## RevOps Documentation Standard

All component documentation follows a consistent structure:

- **README.md**: Human-readable narrative documentation
- **_facts/*.yaml**: Machine-readable structured metadata
- **Dependencies**: Tracked in [/_graph/dependencies.json](../_graph/dependencies.json)
- **Registry**: All components cataloged in [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml)
- **Quality**: Coverage metrics in [/_quality/coverage-report.yaml](../_quality/coverage-report.yaml)

## How Documentation is Generated

This documentation is automatically generated from the Dataverse environment:

1. **Extraction**: Solution XML files exported from Dataverse
2. **Parsing**: Metadata APIs queried for schema details
3. **Analysis**: Dependencies extracted from configurations and code
4. **Generation**: Structured YAML + narrative Markdown created
5. **Validation**: Coverage and quality metrics calculated

**Generation Runs**: Stored in [/RUNS/](../RUNS/) with timestamps and diff reports

## For RevOps Copilot Agents

**Interpretation Guidance:**
- Start with the README.md for context and navigation
- Use `_facts/*.yaml` files for structured queries
- Cross-reference [/_graph/dependencies.json](../_graph/dependencies.json) for relationships
- Check [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml) for component lifecycle (active/added/removed)

**Common Query Patterns:**
- "What components exist?" → Browse subfolders or check [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml)
- "What does component X do?" → Read component's README.md
- "What depends on component X?" → Use [/_graph/reverse-index.yaml](../_graph/reverse-index.yaml)
- "What changed recently?" → Check [/RUNS/](../RUNS/) for latest diff report

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (95-100%)**: Direct metadata extraction (names, types, relationships)
- **Moderate (70-90%)**: Parsed configurations (forms, business rules, flow actions)
- **Low (50-70%)**: Inferred logic and complex dependencies
