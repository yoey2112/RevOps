# Flows (Cloud Flows) Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for all Power Automate cloud flows in the RevOps environment. Flows are automated workflows that orchestrate business processes, integrate systems, and respond to events within and beyond the Power Platform ecosystem.

**Audience:**
- RevOps developers and solution architects
- Copilot agents performing analysis and impact assessment
- Business analysts understanding system capabilities

## What's Documented Here

Each flow has its own subfolder containing:

- **README.md**: Narrative explanation of flow logic, purpose, and business context
- **_facts/flow-actions.yaml**: Action-by-action breakdown with inputs, outputs, and table operations
- **_facts/metadata.yaml**: Flow trigger type, state, owner, and solution membership
- **_facts/dependencies.yaml**: Extracted dependencies on tables, connection references, and child flows

## How to Navigate

**To find a specific flow:**
- Browse subfolders by display name (normalized with hyphens, lowercase)
- Flow folders may include prefix indicators for categorization

**To understand what a flow does:**
- Start with the README.md for business context and high-level logic
- Review `_facts/flow-actions.yaml` for step-by-step action breakdown
- Check `_facts/dependencies.yaml` for table and connection dependencies

## RevOps Documentation Standard

All component documentation follows a consistent structure:

- **README.md**: Human-readable narrative documentation
- **_facts/*.yaml**: Machine-readable structured metadata
- **Dependencies**: Tracked in [/_graph/dependencies.json](../_graph/dependencies.json)
- **Registry**: All components cataloged in [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml)
- **Quality**: Coverage metrics in [/_quality/coverage-report.yaml](../_quality/coverage-report.yaml)

## How Documentation is Generated

This documentation is automatically generated from the Dataverse environment:

1. **Extraction**: Solution XML files exported from Dataverse
2. **Parsing**: Metadata APIs queried for schema details
3. **Analysis**: Dependencies extracted from configurations and code
4. **Generation**: Structured YAML + narrative Markdown created
5. **Validation**: Coverage and quality metrics calculated

**Generation Runs**: Stored in [/RUNS/](../RUNS/) with timestamps and diff reports

## For RevOps Copilot Agents

**Interpretation Guidance:**
- Start with the README.md for context and navigation
- Use `_facts/*.yaml` files for structured queries
- Cross-reference [/_graph/dependencies.json](../_graph/dependencies.json) for relationships
- Check [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml) for component lifecycle (active/added/removed)

**Common Query Patterns:**
- "What components exist?" → Browse subfolders or check [/_registry/assets.yaml](../_registry/assets.yaml)
- "What does component X do?" → Read component's README.md
- "What depends on component X?" → Use [/_graph/reverse-index.yaml](../_graph/reverse-index.yaml)
- "What changed recently?" → Check [/RUNS/](../RUNS/) for latest diff report

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (95-100%)**: Direct metadata extraction (names, types, relationships)
- **Moderate (70-90%)**: Parsed configurations (forms, business rules, flow actions)
- **Low (50-70%)**: Inferred logic and complex dependencies

## Related Documentation
